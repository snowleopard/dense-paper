# Range Queries and Dense Linear Operators

We revisit the classical problem of computing range queries over an idempotent semigroup
and its natural special case, computing a dense linear operator. Specifically, we are
interested in the minimum number of semigroup operations needed to answer all the queries.
For commutative semigroups, we show that the special case is strictly easier: while for
range queries a superlinear lower bound is known, a dense linear operator can be computed
by linear size circuits. We then study the role of commutativity in these problems: it
turns out to be unimportant for range queries but crucial for dense operators. Moreover,
without commutativity both problems are equivalent.
